          Madorelle is a beauty care brand that specializes in all things
          cosmetics, that primarily look to enhace skin care as needed. Located
          in the environs of AFRICA, Madorelle is looking to going global. One
          method of this was company branding, of which the client in question
          sought to requesting for AY-DESIGNS' services to assist in product
          branding.

          Skin care is not a thing of "age-group", and even when it is, we can
          take ranges from an average 16 year old teen to an average 60 year
          old. For this project, the target audience is of course the general
          public, irrespective of age, BUT looking critically at the much older
          set of people with some adequate understanding of WHAT exactly skin
          care products are for you.
          <br /><br />
          Another point of focus here is gender! Although skin care is NOT
          limited to a certain gender, it is seen (especially in the given
          location of the company), that a huge percentage of the population
          attracted to this kind of service are the females. <br />
          With this in mind the focus primarily has to be directed towards them.
          <br />
          <br />
          Skin Care product branding with <i>flyer-type designs</i> requires
          that the user's attention should be gotten at first glance. AY-DESIGNS
          aimed at targeting precisely, using images and colorful fonts, the
          user attention per type of product.

          Due to the fact that there were multiple products being developed by
          Madorelle, multiple meetings were set-up where the names and
          description of each product were given. This of course helped
          AY-DESINGS know exactly how to convey the information needed.
          <br /><br />
          The designs needed were all to be printed out at stickers to fit on
          the necessary products. Thus for each bottled product, precise
          dimensions were to be given such that there were no errors made.
          <br />
          Color choices were very STRICT as the client inteded that the
          products' color should match somehow with the sticker color. The color
          of products were given per product where possible and the design
          complemented it.

          As this was a contract based type of work, it wasn't aimed at a daily
          time frame for service delivery but rather about a week's interval.
          <br />
          The ability to work with a client with such magnitude of work was
          indeed a propelling force to excellence levels for AY-DESIGNS. <br />
          Branding for this company still continues with AY-DESIGNS being the
          sole designing agency. It is safe to say that a trustworthy
          relationship has been established
