          Client reached out asking for a 3-ind-1 package flyer, that would be
          used to showcase his service, which is building websites for clients
          who wish to ship products and track their motion. Essentially, 3
          flyers were needed to show; <br />
          - General information about the service <br />
          - Price list and packages offered <br />
          - Samples of work done <br />

          The first task for me was to know who the target audience is! Given
          that our client isn't looking to work only locally, a global audience
          was being reached at. Thus, getting clarity with the audience targeted
          made it sort of challenging, as we're looking at diversity in
          individuals across nations of the world. <br />
          In terms of age group, teens are less of the target and more of adults
          between ages 21 - 45. <br />
          This is what was concluded upon!
          <br />
          <br />
          The complexity of the flyer was meant to be very very minimal, as the
          aim is for all information to be clearly seen throughout with little
          or no distractions on the design. <br />
          This brought in a rather subtle choice of colors; ones that are more
          easily visually comprehended by the brain in terms of familiarity, as
          well as fonts.
          <br />
          <br />
          Flyer sizes were manipulated based on content per design but wasn't
          really a hassle, as it was mainly to be used for online publicity.

          The client in this case was very generous to provide all information
          needed way before hand; such as the name, Standard Tracking, which was
          going to be the brand name. The contact information, and other
          discrete related content for the design as pleased.
          <br /><br />
          From a graphic designer's point of view, it was worth noting FIRST
          that if there were going to be 3 designs for this same project, it's
          important to have a sense of familiarity between the designs. <br />
          Of course colors and fonts were played a strategic role in this, but a
          visual image would seal the deals. Hence, AY-DESIGNS sought out to
          creating a <i>Logo-type representation</i>
          primarily for use on the design and not as a commercial service
          provider.

          Overall, a time frame of 5 hours was used to complete the 3 designs
          needed, of course with back-to-back verification and corrections from
          the client. It was a task worth doing and has paid off for the client
          in his line of work.
